Section 1 Article 1

AMENDS ORIGINAL PROVISION TO SECTION 1 OF ARTICLE 1 IN THE Oregon CONSTITUTION, ADDS NUMBERING AND NEW SUB-SECTIONS ON POWER INHERENTLY RESIDING WITHIN THE PEOPLE, DUTY TO REBEL, and RIGHT OF REVOLUTION
 
(1) We the People of the State of Oregon find and declare, that in order to ensure the liberties and necessary security of the rights of nature in we members of humankind, and to ensure consistency with respect to the fair application of natural law to all persons, who are principally bound to abide by its cornerstones, we, as with all People, are independent, and to be our own masters over our selves, as each one of us shall so desire, as each one of us is endowed by the universe with free will and Autonomy by our nature, being slaves to nobody (and at most, upon our discretion, indentured servants for a fixed number of years as we may so desire and consent), insofar as each of us commit no act of natural crime or otherwise perpetrate injustice upon another, their property, or any other rights. So long as a person commits no fundamental evil against another, they are rendered free to do with themself, their property, and all other rights, and to dispose of all these as they shall see fit, given the direct stipulation that they not interfere with the equal rights in another to do the same with their own self. Given this essential Freedom in Liberty, the ability to protect these rights with impunity must be afforded defense by law, and additionally be secured by members of Government where they are so able to benefit and safeguard the People, when they are able to do so. The natural power in a person to do as they please with themself within the limit to allow others to do the same with theirself, shall also freely permit without license or need of let by another to afford their own self-security and self-defense, resistance against injustice, rebellion against tyranny, revolution against arbitrary and/or illegitimate Government, and the Liberty to perform all needful actions and implement all necessary tools and devices to affect a sufficient response to any usurpation as it may so arrise from time to time. Given that these foundational precepts are fundamental to our sovereignty as Individuals, we the People of Oregon, as Citizens of the United States, residents of the World, occupants of the Universe, and members of reality, now do establish, ordain, and enact the following provisions to be incorporated into the constitution of Oregon, and Command our Government to abide by its authority and directives in favour of the rights of Persons. 

(2) We find and declare that all People are endowed with Universal, Fundamental, Inherent, Inalienable, Natural Rights, among those are the rights to Life and Health, Liberty/Freedom and Autonomy, Self-security [and the freedom to lawfully and justly secure others whom mutually consent] and Self-Defense  [and the freedom to lawfully and justly defend others whom mutually consent], Privacy, Property, and the Pursuit of Happiness, and that when they form a social compact, are to be equally respected in these rights, with no one Individual or group of Individuals superior in right or power to any other Individual; that all power stems from the rights inherent in the People, and that all free [civil] governments are founded upon their (the People's) authority, and instituted for their Liberty, Peace, Safety, and Happiness; and they have at all times a right to alter, reform, or abolish the government in such manner as they may think proper.

(3) As all power is originally inherent in and consequentially derived from the People, therefore, all members of government, whether Judicial, Legislative, or Executive are their trustees and servants; and at all times, in a legal way are accountable to them; All members of Government [including but not limited to public officials and officers] are servants of the whole community, and not of any one group thereof, except of course for such community at large/whole;

(4) Rebellion against tyranny. being an essential Pillar to uphold Freedom/Liberty, in order to Promote the Natural as well as Constitutional rights, and Secure Justice, a Citizen's Natural Duty to rebel shall be secured by law, which itself refers to the essential duty of any Person, but Particularly the Citizenry, to rebel against unjust laws, orders, and actions that are contrary to, de-valuate, or which do violate any of the natural rights or natural justice, such as, but not limited to Life and Health, Liberty/Freedom and Autonomy, Self-security and Self-defense [and the freedom to secure or defend others], Privacy, Property/Estate, and the Pursuit of Happiness, which are fundamental in themselves and inalienable. This duty entails that People dismiss, oppose, forcibly resist, and correct any violations of natural and constitutional rights, as well as such justice, against any unjust law, order, or action of any level of government, or any contractor/s beneath them, in any jurisdiction, including from imminent threats against Individuals, such as Standing Armies or Police Forces erected to enforce violations of volition.

(5) All People recognize the right [and duty] of revolution; that is, the right [and duty] to refuse allegiance to, and to resist the government, when its tyranny and inefficiency, oppression, and/or usurpation are great and un-endurable. Resistance to injustice is the consequence of the other rights of Individuals. The doctrine of non-resistance against arbitrary Power and Injustice is absurd, slavish, repugnant to a free People, and destructive of the good and happiness of humankind. Whenever the government endeavor to take away and destroy the lives and/or property of the People, or reduce them to slavery under arbitrary power and/or absolute dominion, they put themselves into a state of war with the People, who are thereupon absolved from any further obedience, and are left to the common refuge, which is provided for all People universally, against force and violence. Whensoever therefore the Government shall transgress this fundamental rule of society; and either by Ambition, Fear, Folly, or Corruption, endeavor to grasp themselves, or put into the hands of any other an absolute power over the lives, liberties, properties/estates, and/or any other right of the People; by this breach of trust they forfeit the power the People had put into their hands for quite contrary ends, and it devolves to the People, who have a right to resume their original Liberty. Those who incite, dispatch, Sign, or Execute Arbitrary or Unjust Acts or Orders, or cause them to be executed, must be punished seriously. The decision to support, aid, assist, or oppose any foreign government or revolutionary movement will be reserved to the People, as Individuals.

Section 9 Article 1

AMENDS Oregon CONSTITUTION ARTICLE 1 SECTION 9 WITH MORE STRINGENT REQUIREMENTS FOR DETENTIONS, WARRANTS, AND ARRESTS

No law shall violate the right of Persons to be secure in their Persons, Personal and Private information/records which include but are not limited to medical and psychological information/records, papers, homes, effects, location as well as network information, electronic and radio data (including but not limited to: Meta-data) as well as private communications, from [any and all] un-reasonable and un-warranted searches, seizures and storage; Nor shall any person be stopped or detained unreasonably, neither but upon probable cause, for the sole purpose of temporarily retaining them while a warrant may be secured to proceed in search or seizure; and no warrant to search any place, seize any person or thing, or access electronic/radio data or communications, shall issue without particularly describing the place to be searched, the person or thing to be seized, tracked, or put under surveillance, or the data or communication to be accessed or stored, as nearly as may be; nor without a modicum of credible evidence for which it is apparent that the accused has likely committed an offense against the rights of another person (which evidence may include or be the statement of a witness sworn under oath by pain and penalty of law for its falsification by any measure or degree), which shall be presented to a judge of competent jurisdiction to provide authorization. Neither shall Oregon pass or enforce any law abridging or infringing the right of the People to encrypt their documents, effects, data, and communications.

JuryReform Initiative Draft v1.3.2

AMENDS Oregon CONSTITUTION ARTICLE 1 SECTION 16 by SPLITTING UP AND ADDING NEW NUMBERED PROVISIONS TO ENHANCE PROTECTIONS AGAINST EXCESSIVE FINES AND CRUEL OR UNUSUAL PUNISHMENTS, REFINE JURY POWER TO JUDGE LAW AND FACT, AND, PERMIT JURY TO ACQUIT CRIMINAL DEFENDANT PROVEN GUILTY and PERMIT JURY TO STRIKE DOWN UNCONSTITUTIONAL OR UNJUST LAWS

(1) Excessive bail shall not be required, or excessive fines be imposed, neither excessive terms of incarceration, or any other excessive form of criminal punishment, nor any torturous, cruel, degrading, or unusual treatments or punishments be inflicted.

(2) There shall be proportionality of a punishment for a crime, in the forfeiture of property for the magnitude of a felony, and in the fines for both felonies and misdemeanors, weighing on an individual basis given the facts and circumstances under which a crime took place, fitting a specific punishment to serve the needs of the community for protection against recidivism while at the same time without applying excessive punishment, to achieve reasonable outcomes for the equal interests of both the convicted and their victims.

(3) It is the natural right of every citizen of the state of Oregon, when serving on a civil-trial or criminal-trial jury, to judge both the law and the facts pertaining to the case before the jury, in order to determine whether justice will be served by applying the law to the defendant. It is mandatory that all jurors be informed of this right. Before the jury hears a case, and again before jury deliberation begins, the court shall inform jurors of their rights in these words: "As jurors, your first responsibility is to decide whether the prosecution has proven beyond a reasonable doubt every element of the civil/criminal liability/charge. If you decide that the prosecution has proven beyond a reasonable doubt every element of the civil/criminal liability/charge but you cannot in good conscience support a liable/guilty verdict, you are not required to do so. To reach a verdict which you believe is just, each of you has the right to consider to what extent the []defendant's[] actions have actually caused harm or otherwise violated your sense of right and wrong. If you believe justice requires it, you may also judge both the merits of the law under which the []defendant[] has been [held] liable/charged and the wisdom of applying that law to the defendant. Accordingly, for each charge against the []defendant[], even if review of the evidence strictly in terms of the law would indicate a liable/guilty verdict, you have the right to find the defendant not liable/guilty. The court cautions that with the exercise of this right comes the full moral responsibility for the verdict you bring in." As part of their oath, the jurors shall affirm that they understand the information concerning their rights which this section requires the court to give them, and that no party to the trial may be prevented from encouraging jurors to exercise this right. For the jurors to be so informed is declared to be part of the defendant's fundamental right to a fair trial by jury, and failure to conduct any criminal trial in accordance with this section shall not constitute harmless error, and shall be grounds for a mistrial. No potential juror may be disqualified from serving on a jury because they express willingness to judge the law or its application, or to vote according to their conscience.

(4) Juries retain the right to vote their conscience, and the power to strike down as void and unlawful any laws in conflict with the constitution, with the duty to elaborate upon the decision for the benefit of the People, and the responsibility to do so mindfully and only upon serious consideration through their deliberations.

AMENDS Article 1 Section 11 of the Oregon CONSTITUTION by numbering and altering the previous provision, and adding a new [numbered] provision beneath which both: REQUIRE UNANIMOUS JURY DECISIONS and REQUIRE A FULLY INFORMED JURY

(1) In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall have the right to public trial by an impartial jury in the county in which the offense shall have been committed; to be heard by himself and counsel; to demand the nature and cause of the accusation against him, and to have a copy thereof; to meet the witnesses face to face, and to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor; provided, however, that any accused person, in other than capital cases, and with the consent of the trial judge, may elect to waive trial by jury and consent to be tried by the judge of the court alone, such election to be in writing; provided however, that they shall only be found guilty by unanimous verdict, and not otherwise; provided further, that the existing laws and constitutional provisions relative to criminal prosecutions shall be continued and remain in effect as to all prosecutions for crimes committed before the taking effect of this amendment.

(2) Criminal defendants have the right to be served justice by a fully informed jury, who know all of their Rights, Powers, Duties, and Responsibilities, as well as who are learned and understand all basic legal rules and procedures as well as definitions, and whom know all relevant laws and case rulings, as they are applicable to the case at hand.

section 47 article 1 amend of Oregon constitution (slip-streamed):

AMENDS Oregon CONSTITUTION by creating a new section (47) which: SETS FORTH THAT PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION IS CIVIL SERVICE, ENUMERATES RIGHT OF RESISTANCE, and ENUMERATES RIGHT OF DEFENSE (possibly more, being slip-streamed right now)

-

(1) The Agents and members of the Public Administration, and those contracting beneath the government [while in actual service], are intended to operate as a civil service, and shall at all times be answerable and held accountable to "the People" of Oregon as Public Servants.

(2) It is proper for People to Protect themselves, their families, and others from intruders and attackers without fear of Prosecution or civil action for acting in defense of themselves and others, including against their property. Each Individual has the Inalienable [Natural] right of Self-Defense against the Initiation of [unjust] force, or any other form of aggression. No Individual or association of Individuals, however constituted, has the right to initiate force against any other individual; No one may rightfully threaten, or commit, the initiation of aggression/offensive_violence/[un-just]_force against another Person or their Property; Written, verbal, and physical threats of imminent Physical Violence are sufficient justification for a defensive response in a physical manner; violence may be [justly] employed only against the Individual/s who threaten/s to or do/es commit such violence, that is, only defensively against the aggressive violence of another or others; No violence may be [justly] employed against [a] non-aggressor/s.

(3) Everyone possesses an inherent right to defend their natural rights, including [upon their discretion] with lethal force, as may be prescribed by this constitution and the laws made in accordance therewith. All Persons shall have secured by law their right of self-defense as well as defense of their property, along with any natural and constitutional rights, and for other persons who are under a direct and real threat, against initiators of aggression, including any Agent of the Public Administration acting unlawfully or in error, regardless of if it is within the discharge of their duties or performed in good faith. This right shall include the right to resist any law or order that infringes on their rights, freedoms, or guarantees, and to use sufficient force to repel or effect an end to any violation of themself or other true aggression against them. This shall also include the right to resist any assualts against them constituting an unlawful arrest or a illegal restraint, as well as to escape wrongful detentions and false imprisonment. There is no duty to retreat before engaging in defense of one's or another's rights, and nobody shall be charged with a criminal offense for standing their ground in the face of an attack against them, their property, or interference with the exercise of any right, freedom, or guarantee. People convicted for resisting unlawful arrest shall be released from imprisonment immediately and have their charges connected to such resistance expunged, including any attempted or successful defensive force upon the assaulting officer/s attempting to affect the illegal arrest, before or after any illegal entry by the offender, if there be any.

(4) All Persons shall have the right of self-defense as well as of defense of their Property, Person, as well as any Natural and Constitutional rights, and for others who are under a direct and real threat, against initiators of aggression. Defense of property is defense of self, as it it a defense of one's rights. A person is justified in using physical force upon another Person to defend themself or others, or their Property, as well as any Natural and Constitutional rights from what they believe beyond irrefutable proof to be the use or imminent use of aggression or [un-just]_force/attack/offensive_violence; In defending, a person may use whatever force they deem necessary, including with maximum escalation, without need to alert anyone to their injury, or warn about their iminient use of defensive force first. Any violations of natural or Constitutional rights may be met with lethal force, upon the discretion of the victim, regardless of if it was an accident/error, even when performed in good faith without malice. As with any form of aggression against another, whether theft, fraud, the initiation of [un-just]_force/attack/offensive_violence, interference with any right, or the imminent threat therof, the law shall not require the assailed Part[y]/ies to weigh with great nicety/signification the probable extent of the attack upon them or another, and they may freely decide to use the most violent means against their or another's assailant, as the defender shall deem proper, even to the extent of ending the assailant's life. A defender cannot, as a matter principle, be criminally charged or held civilly liable for any act or response to an aggressor or initiator of[un-just]_force/attacker/violator, nor for wounding the aggressor. The People, as a popular sovereign, at all times, are ensured this right, without need of restraint, as a means of their Independence.

(5) The Castle Doctrine and defense of a person's lands, is a legal doctrine of ancient origins that designates a Person's abode, or any legally occupied place such as a vehicle/craft or home, and the property they own or lawfully control, regardless of whether it is where the abode is parked or placed, is a place in which that Person has protections and immunities permitting one, in certain circumstances as laid forth by law, to use force [including deadly force] to defend oneself or one's property against an intruder, free from legal prosecution for the consequences of the force used; Persons residing in or visiting this Commonwealth have a right to expect to remain unmolested on or within their land, homes, or vehicles/crafts. No Person should be required to surrender their personal safety to a criminal, nor should a Person be required to needlessly retreat in the face of intrusion or attack outside the person's dwelling or vehicle/craft.

(6) No Person should be required to surrender their perosnal safety to a Criminal, nor should a person be required to needlessly retreat in the face of intrusion or attack outside the Person's Dwelling or Vehicle/Craft, nor their business/es.

(7) No law shall abridge the right of self-defense and defense of others against initiators of aggression, including, but not limited to, any members of the Public Administration where acting unlawfully or in error.

(8) Everyone shall possess the right to resist any law or order given by the Public Administration or its members and contractors beneath the government [in actual service], if the Person/s reasonably believe the law or order to be in opposition to the will of "the People", or that which infringes on their rights, freedoms, or guarantees, whether natural or otherwise, and that they may furthermore refuse to co-operate with them as well for the same reason, as well as to use sufficient [including if needed, lethal] force to repel any aggression, as may seem to them to be reasonably necessary.

(9) Everyone may resist unlawful arrest and unlawful detention, as well as escape false imprisonment, without legal consequence, up to the point of taking an arresting officer's or other person's life if reasonably necessary to sufficiently repel the assault and battery, or kidnapping, constitution the arrest or illegal confinement. So too shall be secured everyone's right to repel unlawful entry by any public servant, including up to using lethal force to defend land or premises from illegal invasion.

(10) Upon enactment of this section, those who are, or were previously charged or sentenced under statutes or rulings in conflict with and contrary to this section shall be immediately released from imprisonment, automatically granted immediate pardon and expungement for the false crimes for which they were convicted of, + receive full pardon and repreive from the gubernor, be resituted for the entire duration of time in which they were imprisoned, detained, or incarcerated, and all Statutes and Instructions to the Jury, and any judicial ruling contrary to it shall immediately become invalid on their face, and be null and void, with no more effect.

(11) For the purposes of this constitution, "Aggression" is in the context to the [mutual] non-aggression principle, and shall be defined as threatening or initiating any forcible interference with an Individual, or Individual's property, or the exercise of any of their rights, freedoms, or guarantees therewith. The non-aggression principle does not forbid defensive posturing or forceful defense. "Force" (or Compulsion/Coercion/Extortion) is defined as Taking/Damaging/destroying or threatening to Take/Damage/Destroy someone else's Life and Health, Liberty/Freedom and Autonomy, Self-Security [and freedom to secure others'] and Self-Defense [and freedom to defend others'], Privacy, Property, and the Pursuit of Happiness.

abolish_taxes

(1)
We the People of Oregon hereby declare that all portions of our constitution which refer to taxation power be struck down, and for a new series of sections be erected in their place, which incorporate the following as an alternative to a taxation based system, whereby taxation will hereby be abolished permanently within Oregon so long as this provision of law and this section shall apply as the law of the land, and instead the government shall run its own business for providing Goods and Services for sale to the Public and others upon the terms set by the People.

(2)
For it is surely the plunder of an Individual's property, the fruits of their labor, and the freedom of volition to voluntarily transact as the Individual, whose rights are affected, with their non-transferable non-negotiable  right to revocable fully-informed xxx consent, may so see fit, in which the collective sucks the lifeblood of the Individual's productivity, for the State's outrageous justifications for their demands, having imposed force upon a non-aggressing Sovereign person, who had committed no injustice by exercising their inalienable right ot property, Taxation by Oregon or on its behalf is hereby abolished; -And, Being that taxation is the legalized plunder of the fruits of ones labor and productivity, the blood letting by venomous leeches which suck the sustenance out of the people, and have them converted into meat to be fed to their brethren, taxation by Oregon or on its behalf is hereby abolished permanently.

(3)
Oregon shall establish a Department of Goods and Services, and shall have Power to establish facilities, as well as procure resources and labor for the manufacturing and retailing of goods or services desired by the public, to pay for State expenditures that would had otherwise been funded on collected taxes, which Public Sector businesses shall be operated autonomously in like manner to that of a citizen-owned co-op and worker's council [bicameral stakeholder system] where the people's co-op house is the representative branch, and the worker council is the senatorial power, in a profit-for-the-public-good venture; but it shall not have the power to conscript the resources or labor of any person; nor shall it use tax dollars to establish or maintain itself, meaning that the 'Public sector' businesses established must be operated on their own revenues at their own expense, with any profits not re-invested into them placed into the general fund of their State; The States are encouraged to accept donations from the People, designated by the People, for the purpose of funding the Department of Goods and Services; 'Public sector' business shall be subject to the same laws and regulations as Private business, and neither shall hold an exclusive monopoly to operate within Greenway. The People shall be free to petition through Initiative or Referendum to engage/produce, query, or cease any Operation, action, Product, manufacture, method, or other mode of execution in the Department of Goods and Services as so alike shall the Legislature if in conformity to the will of the People's Just Authority.

(4)
Citizens can elect to have any portion of their Individual proportional control of Public funds which are under their direction, allocated to government department[s] and program[s] as they see fit/suitable, and optionally towards reducing the debt of the Nation and/or their State, if such debt exists, as they decide, without the possibility of diversion to non-Individual-specified alternative "absorbing deparment[s]/program[s]". Each department and program shall have spending caps to be determined by the Legislative branch. Once a spending cap is met for any particular department or program, the Citizen's Individual proportional control of Public funds which are under their direction can then be allocated to one of the other departments or programs that they the Individual Citizen may have chosen.

oregon sovereignty package
limits on power (preliminary)
v00.00.00.1

(1) The Powers of the Oregon Public Administration shall be derived solely from the provisions of the Constitution of the United States of America, or this Constitution, and neither the Public Administration, nor any agent or Member thereof shall possess any inherent authority; the Public Administration shall neither have nor exercise any power other than those expressly conferred upon it by this constitution or the constitution of the United States of America, in conjunction to what is set forth in this pact.

(2) All Powers delegated in this constitution are constrained to be exercised only for a proper, or reasonable, rational, and legitimate, Public Purpose, as a fiduciary trust for the general benefit of all People of Oregon and not for the Special Benefit of any part of them, partially but not completely stated in the Preamble of our own State as well as the United States of America. No Power may be extended to accomplish a purpose without amendment. Relative to the People, no branch of Government has inherent or reserved Powers, implicit or assumed Prerogatives, or pre-supposed attributes of sovereignty. Powers must be expressly granted to the government by the People, and the extent and range of such Powers shall be strictly, and narrowly construed;

(3) "Just authority" shall mean a government operating under the will of the People, and in times/circumstances where the government is repugnant to this end, just authority shall rest solely upon the People [themselves], in [strong] consensus, as far as either is within any one [or any other aggregation] of their individual Natural Rights.

(4) The constitution of Oregon shall be interpreted in good faith and literally (within strict constructionism), as far as it does not produce any absurd result, with due regard to the original intention behind its provisions; in case of doubt, consideration may be given to any Statements or Notes related to the text made before or at the time of its adoption.

(5) On all constitutional issues, Precedents shall be regarded as only perhaps persuasive and never binding. Constitutional text shall be construed only on historical evidence of the meaning of the terms for, first, their ratifiers, and second, their framers. Equity and prudential decisions shall not be regarded as precedents.

(6) to the extent that any provisions of this or the United States' constitution are inconsistent with the provisions of any other laws of Oregon, the provisions of those constitutions shall prevail and shall be deemed to supersede the provisions of such laws.

(7) the powers delegated by the Constitution to the Government of Oregon, shall be exercised as therein appropriated, so that the Legislative shall never exercise the Powers vested in the Executive or Judicial; nor the Executive Powers vested in the Legislature or judicial; nor the Judicial POwers vested in the Legislative or Executive.

(8) It is at all times unlawful for United States National Government, Oregon, or any other State Government to at any time "Operate outside of the Constitution".

(9) powers not delegated to the United States of America by its constitution, nor prohibited by it to any other State or States, are reserved to Oregon, or to the People. Relative to the People, no branch of Government has inherent or reserved Powers, implicit or assumed prerogatives, or presupposed attributes of sovereignty. Powers must be expressly granted to government by the People, and the extent and range of such powers shall be strictly and narrowly construed.

(10) the exceptions [to power] here or elsewhere in the constitution made in favor of particular rights, shall not be so construed as to diminish the just importance of other rights retained by the People, or as to enlarge the powers delegated by the Constitution; but either as actual limitations on such powers, or inserted merely for greater caution.

stage one, legalize it 1.5
the first initiative, the least defined in Ghost's mind, and needs feedback from small business owners about what they would have been able to manage when they first started their business, we would like to borrow the opinions directly from farmers in the countryside and perhaps those who sell at farm stands by the side of the road along with those who come to farmer's markets as our best/optimum sample group

stage two, legalize it 1.75
the same as 2.0 except not near schools

stage three, legalize it 2.0
do it at home, by a school
definitely requiring more feedback from blackmarket people who want to go legit and what they think they would be able to manage if they saved up capital from a year of working 8 hour days and saving extra capital for starting an at home business
Ghost's very own startup called semiquote'Son's Mom and Pop Garden and Shop'end-semiquote
[?]right to defend property from theft with force including up to lethal force, including outdoors[?]; in 2.0, make sure people have the right to defend marijuana with force, as with any other form of property, which is one of the []numerous and indefinite[] rights of the People.
[?]allow use of marijuana outdoors at psychological care facilities[?] put into 2.0?
[?]allow use of marijuana outdoors at a jail or prison with the discresion of the warden[?] put into 2.0?

stage four, legalize it 2.35
remove all taxes from it, keep everthing else from 2.0

stage five, legalize it 2.4
removal of limitations on advertising as exist in regards to kids and youth (I.e., advertising that appeals to them or shows them using it); 

stage six, legalize it 2.5
beyond all doubt, this will definately protect the right to defend property from theft with force including up to lethal force, including outdoors, even if legalize it 2.0 does not

stage seven, legalize it 2.65
remove all legal restrictions on the sales except for age of sales
continue purity requirements

stage eight, legalize it 2.825
remove all legal requirements on commercial activity except for age of sales
remove purity requirements

stage nine, legalize it 3.0
essentially, just the definitions amended in this initiative added to RAD arizona 2020, call it the quote"semi-statist's vision of cannabis anarchy"end-quote

OFFICIAL TITLE
Reforming the legalization of Cannabis, Hashish, Cannabinoids, their products, and related paraphenalia.

--

PURPOSE
[]
To de jure legalize cannabis at the constitutional level in Oregon. Opens up home grows and enables the home processing of Cannabis into concentrates/dabs through employment of chemical extractants, removing their previous restrictions. Opens up the cannabis industry by removing plant count or canopy size limits, and removes zoning and most location restrictions that make small startups prohibitively difficult; Removes the requirement of individual licensing for all employees who handle cannabis, now only requiring the business owner to hold a license and inform employees of the laws surrounding Cannabis, Hashish, Cannabinoids, and their products, for all those employees under them to lawfully work. Allows under minor stipulations the smoking and vaping of Cannabis, Hashish, and Cannabinoids in outdoor Public places, and further enables smoking and vaping of cannabis indoors in consenting businesses. Provides other improvements and clarifications (see full text). Sets basic structure for further completion by the State Legislature.

[placeholder notes begin]
[]
Powers not delegated to Oregon by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States, respectively, or to the people thereof. Relative to the people, no branch of government has inherent or reserved powers, implicit or assumed prerogatives, or presupposed attributes of sovereignty. Powers must be expressly granted to government by the People, and the extent and range of such powers shall be strictly and narrowly construed.
[]

[]
The Powers of the Public Administration shall be derived solely from the provisions of this Constitution, or for the States, by their respective Constitutions, and neither the Public Administration, nor any Agent or Member thereof, shall possess any inherent authority; the Public Administration shall neither have nor exercise any power other than those expressly conferred upon it by this Constitution, or for the States, by their respective Constitutions, in conjunction to what is set forth in this pact.

All powers delegated in this Constitution are constrained to be exercised only for a proper, or reasonable, rational, and legitimate, public purpose, as a fiduciary trust for the general benefit of all the People and not for the special benefit of any part of them, partially but not completely Stated in the Preamble. No power is plenary or without limits, and no power may be extended to accomplish a purpose without amendment. Relative to the people, no branch of government has inherent or reserved powers, implicit or assumed prerogatives, or presupposed attributes of sovereignty. Powers must be expressly granted to government by the people, and the extent and range of such powers shall be strictly, narrowly construed.

The Constitution of Oregon shall be interpreted in good faith and literally (within strict constructionism), as far as it does not produce any absurd result, with due regard to the original intention behind its provisions; in case of doubt, consideration may be given to any statements or notes related to the text made before or at the time of its adoption.

On all constitutional issues precedents shall be regarded as only perhaps persuasive and never binding. Constitutional text shall be construed only on historical evidence of the meaning of the terms for, first, their ratifiers, and second, their framers. Equity and prudential decisions shall not be regarded as precedents.

To the extent that any provisions of this Constitution are inconsistent with the provisions of any other laws of Oregon, the provisions of this Constitution shall prevail and shall be deemed to supersede the provisions of such laws.

The powers delegated by the Constitution to the government of Oregon, shall be exercised as therein appropriated, so that the Legislative shall never exercise the powers vested in the Executive or Judicial; nor the Executive the powers vested in the Legislative or Judicial; nor the Judicial the powers vested in the Legislative or Executive.

It is at all times unlawful for the Oregon State government to at any time "operate outside of the constitution".

law to regulate cannabis strain purity:

grape laws in California about minimum content of a variety to be legally labeled that variety in wines
napa valley grown need to be completely grown in napa valley
Appalachian varieties need to be defined


( see: "The Science of Regenerative Cannabis Cultivation Conference in Michigan 2019 Kevin Jodrey A" https://youtu.be/OqF4OKtFTfM?t=7589 )

place-of-origin recognition for where a strain is developed and also for the places they were grown for producing product like seeds, clones, flowers for sale

[]
The designation of an Appellation [for the purpose of sales], shall mean a 'regional variety' of which strain shall be grown, sifted, and bred, over a number of successive generations in native soil within the regional designation's given area, which is meant to signify the acquisition and exhibition of adaptions unique to the local region and climate, which by law will be for a minimum of 10 years;
[]

Appellation [production methodologies] construction; "wine Appellation"; there should be a "cannabis Appellation";
champange model and burgandy model of production
Gene/Jean Coleman from medocino county is killer at making these kind of laws (See video timestamp 2h:09m:31s)

an indoor model and outdoor model, both will work, but they must use native soil and native water sheds; 

grading based on qualities, basing on overall cannabinoid content might be a possible to do, and also based on terps; 

regenerative growing techniques required for appalacians sounds great

natively sourced compost material and other inputs, which shall mean those created on the site of the growing Appellation produced variety; 

champagne model is best for the little guys! lets do this!

The Appellation d'origine contrôlée committee guarantees that all Appellation d'origine contrôlée products will hold to a rigorous set of clearly defined standards. The organization stresses that Appellation d'origine contrôlée products will be produced in a consistent and traditional manner with ingredients from specifically classified producers in designated geographical areas. The products must further be aged at least partially in the respective designated area.

Under French law, it is illegal to manufacture and sell a product under one of the Appellation d'origine contrôlée-controlled geographical indications if it does not comply with the criteria of the Appellation d'origine contrôlée. Appellation d'origine contrôlée products can be identified by a seal, which is printed on the label in wines, and with cheeses, on the rind. To prevent any possible misrepresentation, no part of an Appellation d'origine contrôlée name may be used on a label of a product not qualifying for that Appellation d'origine contrôlée.

This strict label policy can lead to confusion, especially in cases where towns share names with appellations. If the town of origin of a product contains a controlled appellation in its name, the producer (who is legally required to identify the place of origin on the product label but legally prohibited from using the full town's name unless the product is an approved Appellation d'origine contrôlée product) is enjoined from listing anything more than a cryptic postal code. For example, there are a dozen townships in l'Aude that have Cabardès in their names, several of which are not even within the geographical boundaries of the Cabardès Appellation d'origine contrôlée. Maybe to solve this, use a bio-regional attribute to labeling. Any vineyard that produces wine in one of those towns must not mention the name of the town of origin on the product labels.
